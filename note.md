.populate('user')
This tells Mongoose to replace the user field in the current document(s) with the document(s) from the user collection that matches the ID or IDs stored in the user field.

After executing a query that returns documents from a MongoDB collection, you can use populate to replace reference fields (usually ObjectIds) with the actual documents from a referenced collection.
